# Raytracer

This is my own implementation of the raytracing program described in [Peter Shirley's "Ray Tracing in One Weekend"](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), an online book that teaches a bit about raytracing and how to implement it in C++.

I've made a number of deviations from the original code in the book for the sake of optimization, consistency and expansion of the base features present in the original.
